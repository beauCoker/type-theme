title: Nespresso pH Test
---

Without doubt, a burning question on every Nespresso user's mind is the pH of the various flavors of espresso. Luckily, I have taken the initiative to answer this vital question.

To do this, I used two-point calibration (4.01 and 7.00) of an [Eleckcity pH meter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FJFEB2O/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on 9 different flavors of Nespresso coffee (I would have done more, but even I can't drink that many espressos). Here was my setup:

This was my first time using the device, so I divided the experiment into two separate trials:

*	Trial 1: pH meter calibrated once at beginning of trial. Temperature range = 87-91 (F)
*	Trial 2: pH meter calibrated three times during trial. Temperature range = 78-82 (F)

Note that each trial is on the same sample. The purpose of the trials is to validate my use of the pH meter since I'm assuming the Nespresso manufacturing is consistent enough keep the pH approximately the same for each flavor. As you'll see below, I did include a duplicate Ciocattino to test this and the results were quite similar across the two samples.

Since I probably should have recalibrated after each measurement, I think the order of the measurements is important to note. So, here is the exact order of the measurements by trial and the number of measurements since the last recalibration:

Now, we can look at the results. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the consistency between the two trials --- the maximum difference in pH is 0.12. Here are a few observations:

*	Rosabaya de Colombia is the most acidic, which isn't surprising.
*	Monsoon Malabar is significantly more basic than the others.
*	The two trials of Ciocattino are highly correlated, which gives me confidence my measurements are fairly accurate.

At last, Nespresso users can sleep at night.
