Hi there! I'm Beau.

I’m currently a master’s student in Statistical Science at Duke University. Previously, I was a quantitative researcher at State Street Associates, which is a financial research group and partnership with a few professors at Harvard and MIT.


In general, I’m interested in statistical mechanics, critical phenomena, stock market crashes, and, more recently, Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Also, cooking and basketball.

To see some of my research, check out the [Tufts Soft Matter Theory Group](https://sites.tufts.edu/softmattertheory/people/) and my undergraduate thesis [*Do Physical Analogies of Stock Market Crashes Make Sense?*](http://hdl.handle.net/10427/78127)
